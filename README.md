##What is this purpose of this Git repository?

This repository is a compilation of the work I completed for the COMP 20 Web Programming Class at Tufts University, Spring 2015.

##What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was Assignment 4, the Marauder's Map server. 

I thoroughly enjoyed implementing each of the APIs and learning how to get Express, NodeJS, and MongoDb work together.

##How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I think I have grown significantly.

Though I entered knowing some basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery, I feel that this course provided me with both a deeper understanding of the topics I already knew and an exposure to those topics that I did not.

Over the course of the semester, I learned a whole new host of skills from server-side development (with Express, NodeJS, and MongoDb) to asychronous and anonymous functions.

##What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

Asychronous functions.

Knowing how asychronous functions operate and how to work with state change events, calling functions only after tasks have completed has been an essential skill. Necessary not only for completing Assignments 3 and 4, a thorough understanding of these functions is necessary for using APIs and different libraries around the web.

Though my use of these functions is currently being applied to harness the Google Places API and Yelp API for our group project, any future web development side projects I take part in will surely also utilize these functions as well.

##Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

After both Assignment 4 and implementing the server methods for our group project, my interest has been piqued in server-side development.

In the future, I would like to delve into investigating other server storage methods (other than MongoDB), learning about the advantages and disadvantages they offer compared to Mongo.
