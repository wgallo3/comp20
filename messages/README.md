# COMP20-LAB6

1.  All aspects of the homework requested have been implemented correctly.

    There exists one page (index.html), one stylesheet (style.css), one data file (data.json), 
    and one JavaScript file (lab.js) which together post the messages (and corresponding users)
    found in the data file.

    The index.html and data.json files have not been altered from their initial states; all work 
    has been done in style.css and lab.js.

    Attempting to load an external URI (http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/messages.json) does not
    work due to JavaScript's same origin policy.

2.  I have not collaborated with anyone on this homework.

3.  Approximately 2 hours were spent on this assignment.
