1.  All aspects of the homework requested have been implemented correctly.

    There exists one page (index.html) and one stylesheet (style.css), which together detect the
    user's location (via the navigation.geolocation object), post it to the given datastore API, 
    and display the updated Marauder's map.

    On the Marauder's map, the user is displayed as a red dot; when clicked, their info window
    reads "My Location." Other users are displayed as a black dot; when clicked, their info windows
    display their username as well as their distance from the user.

2.  I have not collaborated with anyone on this homework.

3.  Approximately 5 hours were spent on this assignment.
