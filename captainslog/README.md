1.  All aspects of the homework requested have been implemented correctly.

    There exists one page (index.html) which allows a user to enter a message and hit enter to post
    it on the web page and stores it in their browers's local storage.

    Note, this webpage only works as long as the user has a working internet connection; it's 
    loading of the JQuery library requires access to the resources located at URL
    https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js.

2.  I have not collaborated with anyone on this homework.

3.  Approximately 30 minutes were spent on this assignment.
