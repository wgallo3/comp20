1.	All aspects of the homework requested have been implemented correctly.

	There exists one page (index.html), one stylesheet (style.css), and one JavaScript file (game.js) which together
	combine to produce a webpage displaying the May 21, 2010 Google Pacman tribute along with Ms. Pacman.

	The index.html and style.css files have not been altered from their initial states; all work has been done in game.js.

	The image displayed on the webpage has been produced using spriting, splitting up the image pacman10-hp-sprite.png.

2. 	I have not collaborated with anyone on this homework.

3. 	Approximately 30 minutes were spent on this assignment.
