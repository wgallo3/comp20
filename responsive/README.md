1.	All aspects of the homework requested have been implemented correctly.

	There exists one page - index.html - and one stylesheet - responsive.css - which is responsive to changes in screen size. The image 
	software.png has been split up using CSS sprites into 8 seperate images, all of which are displayed when the display screen is of
	varying widths.

2. 	I have not collaborated with anyone on this homework.

3. 	Approximately 1 hour was spent on this assignment.
